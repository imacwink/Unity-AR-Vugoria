Qualcomm Vuforia provides a complete AR plugin for us, Vuforia SDK is a set of relatively complete can directly call the AR API, and compared with other AR SDK, it is more stable in image recognition.
The development environment we use here is Unity3D, the free game engine. It provides a powerful cross platform, so that we can easily generate mobile end applications.
